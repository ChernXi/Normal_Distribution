# Normal_Distribution

## Introduction
Normal Distribution is the distribution for **cumulative values of random constant**.<br>
This has nothing to do with the physical laws, this is purely a mathematical/statistical result. <br>
Yes, unchanged(at least quasi-static) physical laws allow the mathematics to take part in nature, therefore many observations follow the normal distribution, but other than that, the content of physical laws is irrelavant to the validity of the normal distribution.

We can convince ourselves from a simple example as demonstrated below.

## An example to show why normal distribution is purely a distribution of the cumulative values of random constant.
Consider this problem: <br>
**What is the marks distribution of 100000 students who blindly do a paper of 20000 true of false questions, with 1 mark per question?** <br>
We see that this has nothing to do with the physical laws, yet the result will follow the normal distribution, because this is a list of the cumulative values generated by random constant.

To do this justify whether this really follow the normal distribution, we can write our code as below:<br>
First, we create a list of marks.
```
import numpy as np
import random
list_mark = []
list1=[0,1]
student_number = 100000
question_number = 20000
for i in range(student_number):
  mark = 0
  for j in range(question_number): 
    mark += random.choice(list1) 
  list_mark.append(mark)
```
